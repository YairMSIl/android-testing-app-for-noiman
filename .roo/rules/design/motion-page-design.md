# Design Document: Motion-Sensing Page

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a new "Motion" page in the application. This page displays real-time data from the device's accelerometer and gyroscope sensors and includes a 3D cube that visualizes the device's orientation.

## 2. Requirements

*   Create a new page accessible from the side menu.
*   Install and configure the `@capacitor/motion` plugin.
*   Listen for and display real-time accelerometer and orientation data.
*   Include a 3D cube that rotates based on the device's orientation.

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1. Dependencies

*   `@capacitor/motion`: To access device motion sensors.

### 3.2. File Changes

*   **`package.json`**: Updated with the new dependency.
*   **`src/router/index.ts`**: Added a new route `/motion` for the `MotionPage`.
*   **`src/views/MotionPage.vue`**: A new component created to display sensor data and the 3D visualization.
*   **`src/App.vue`**: Updated to include a link to the new "Motion" page in the side menu.

### 3.3. Component Logic (`MotionPage.vue`)

*   The component uses `onMounted` and `onUnmounted` lifecycle hooks to manage sensor event listeners.
*   Event listeners for `accel` and `orientation` are registered with the `Motion` plugin.
*   The received sensor data is stored in reactive variables and displayed in the template.
*   A 3D cube is rendered using CSS and its rotation is dynamically updated based on the orientation data.
*   Event listeners are removed in `onUnmounted` to prevent memory leaks.
